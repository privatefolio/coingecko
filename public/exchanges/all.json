MelegaSwap is different at a glance. * Proudly black to make projects shine. * Strictly selective to give users investment opportunities worthy of attention. * Amazingly trendy to keep up with.  Trade. Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed. Swap new Crypto Gems constantly updated selected by the MelegaSwap team.  Earn with Pools. Earn $MARCO and other tokens for free with super high interest rates. Stake $MARCO, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy. MARCO holders right now are earning free tokens each days from the best projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.  Earn with Farms. Earn MARCO with Yield Farms. Stake LP tokens, earn MARCO. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.  Earn with Fees.  No farm? No problem.  Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).  The MelegaSwap offer is enriched by an ILO section and by Melega Space, the HUB of the Melega ecosystem that provides a huge range of professional services to crypto projects including: - Listing on Selected Centralized Exchanges - Market Making Services - Marketing Services - Audit and Legal Services through selected partners.",

With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to new mark",

    "description": "XSwap Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Xinfin network. It serves as an automated liquidity protocol that enables users to exchange various XRC-20 tokens without the need for a centralized intermediary or order book. XSwap operates as a decentralized exchange, meaning it doesn't rely on traditional order books. Instead, it utilizes liquidity pools to facilitate token swaps. Users can trade various Xinfin-based tokens directly from their wallets without the need for a centralized authority.  XSwap uses the concept of AMM, which involves using smart contracts to automate trading functions. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit pairs of tokens into smart contracts, creating liquidity pools. These pools are used to facilitate trades, with prices determined algorithmically based on the ratio of the two tokens in the pool. Users contribute to liquidity pools by depositing an equal value of two tokens into a smart contract. In return, they receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens, representing their share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time, along with a portion of the trading fees generated by the pool. XSwap uses a mathematical formula called the constant product formula (x * y = k) to determine the price of assets in a liquidity pool. The product of the quantities of the two tokens (x and y) remains constant, which allows for price adjustments as the ratio of tokens changes with each trade. Users can easily swap one XRC-20 token for another directly through XSwap's user interface or by interacting with its smart contracts. The trade is executed at the current market price determined by the AMM algorithm. XSwap is a permissionless and open-source protocol. Anyone can access and use the platform without requiring approval.  XSP is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol. Holders of UNI can participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals related to the protocol's development and parameters. XSwap serves as the first launchpad within the XDC network, providing a comprehensive suite of services including token creation, presale initiation, token and liquidity locker, and multisender functionality for all XRC20 tokens. Additionally, XSwap features a robust farming platform and extends its services to include a mobile wallet for user convenience. XSwap plays a pivotal role in the growth of decentralized finance by providing a user-friendly, permissionless, and efficient way for users to trade a wide variety of tokens directly from their wallets.",

Strategy types include: Limit Orders: Set precise buy or sell prices and receive exactly the quoted price. Range Orders: Scale in or out of positions by defining price ranges (e.g., buy a cryptocurrency from $1 down to $0.75). Recurring Orders: Automate \"buy low, sell high\" strategies by linking buy and sell orders. Auto-Compounding Concentrated Liquidity: Choose custom fee tiers, free from tick constraints. Advanced Trading Tools Carbon DeFi’s user interface (UI) includes tools designed to simplify and enhance trading: Simulator: Backtest strategies using historical data for informed decision-making. In-House Drawing Tools: Track trends, pinpoint key levels, and map strategies- all on the UI.

    "description": "Carbon DeFi: A Next-Gen Decentralized Exchange (DEX) by Bancor Carbon DeFi, powered by Bancor, simplifies decentralized trading and liquidity management by enabling strategy makers to create and customize trading strategies with precision and control. At its core is a built-in solver system- a trading bot that integrates seamlessly with major DEXes across a blockchain, leveraging chain-wide liquidity to help ensure efficient order fulfillment. Key Features of Carbon DeFi Strategy makers gain key advantages such as immunity to MEV sandwich attacks, zero slippage, and the ability to edit positions directly onchain. Strategy types include: Limit Orders: Set precise buy or sell prices and receive exactly the quoted price. Range Orders: Scale in or out of positions by defining price ranges (e.g., buy a cryptocurrency from $1 down to $0.75). Recurring Orders: Automate \"buy low, sell high\" strategies by linking buy and sell orders. Auto-Compounding Concentrated Liquidity: Choose custom fee tiers, free from tick constraints. Advanced Trading Tools Carbon DeFi’s user interface (UI) includes tools designed to simplify and enhance trading: Simulator: Backtest strategies using historical data for informed decision-making. In-House Drawing Tools: Track trends, pinpoint key levels, and map strategies- all on the UI. Advanced Activity Tracker: Monitor individual and protocol-wide position performance with CSV export options. Security Carbon DeFi has undergone rigorous audits and operates with zero third party dependencies, such as keepers, oracles, and hooks.",
